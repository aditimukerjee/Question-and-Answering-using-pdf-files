# Question-and-Answering-using-pdf-file

- OUTLINE
Here I figure out three ways of reading Pdf files using Bert Squad 1.1, Distillbert Base Uncased Distilled Squad, and Roberta-Base-Squad2 models.

- DATASET
As training dataset used for developing this question-and-answer model is the current NCERT science (including physics, biology, and chemistry) books for grades 10, 11, and 12. 
The individual chapters from the books were downloaded as pdf files from the NCERT website (https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?lech2=0-7). 

- TASK
The NCRT PDF files are read using the three models mentioned above and follloiwng that any question from that dataset can be answered.
